== Changelog
Possible ideas for future versions

- logging for each server/channel/pm
- Get imagestreams setup, or whatever the kubernetes equivalent is (if it exists yet)
- maybe look into a discord bridge between two other things, or IRC maybe
- the @roles_list is implemented badly, do a get query first before the check for existance when adding a role to a user
- Break out the code into a separate library and create an API to access etc
- Configure bot via config file or via command to set admins/curators
- Integrate with social media, Reddit/Tumblr/Twitter/Minds/Fediverse/Instagram/Pinterest maybe to find pictures or posts of interest to the various room topics.
- Eventually release the bot to allow it to be invited to multiple servers, and run simulataneously.
- figure out how to have users authenticate with their own api keys rather than using mine when posting to a gab group/other social media etc
